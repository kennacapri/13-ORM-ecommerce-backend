# 13-ORM-Ecommerce-Backend

## Description
This database is for managers of an internet retail company to be able to look up products from their e commerce website. Having a backend for their e commerce website will allow the user to compete with other e commerce companies.

## Usage

Then the user can enter schema and seeds commands then the database is created and is seeded with the test data.
